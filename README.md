Developer notes (React + Vite template)

This project uses a minimal React + Vite setup with HMR and ESLint rules. The following notes are included from the original template to help contributors get started:

- Two official plugins are commonly used:
	- `@vitejs/plugin-react` — uses Babel for Fast Refresh
	- `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` — uses SWC for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled in this template because of its impact on dev & build performance. To add it, see the React documentation.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, consider using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. See the Vite React TypeScript template for guidance.

## Local development

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173) to preview the site.
